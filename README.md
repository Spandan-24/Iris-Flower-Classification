# Iris-Flower-Classification
This project implements a machine learning–based Iris flower classification system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The model classifies Iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on four physical features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
